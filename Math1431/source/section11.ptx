    <title>Solving Linear Equations</title>
    
    <p>A linear equation is an equation where the variable appears only to the first power. The general form of a linear equation is <m>ax + b = 0</m>, where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are constants and <m>a \neq 0</m>.</p>
    
    <example xml:id="ex-linear1">
      <statement>
        <p>Solve the equation: <m>2x + 3 = 7</m></p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>We solve this step by step:
          <ul>
            <li><p>Subtract 3 from both sides: <m>2x = 4</m></p></li>
            <li><p>Divide both sides by 2: <m>x = 2</m></p></li>
          </ul>
          Therefore, the solution is <m>x = 2</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
